# technical-assessment-paciente360

Technical assessment to Sr. Full-stack Software Engineer position at Paciente 360.

I have divided the activity into 2 parts, **Front-end using Angular/MaterialUI** and **Back-end using Node/Express/Prisma**.

I will keep both applications in the same repo to make sharing easy.
<br><br>


## How to set up the project:

I have created a **docker-compose.yml** to set up the three services (PostgreSQL, FrontendAngularMaterial and BackendNodeExpressPrisma) so you just need to run the command below and wait.

Make sure that the ports 80, 3000 and 5432 aren't being used.

```
docker-compose up
```

 > ☕ Now you can go grab a coffee as it takes a few minutes to build everything for the first time. ☕

 ### Ready! Everything is fine, you just need to access http://localhost:80 to test the application**
